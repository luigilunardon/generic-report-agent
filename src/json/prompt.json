Your response must be a valid JSON object only\\n- **DO NOT** include any explanations, comments, or introductory text.\\n\\nDecompose the query into an ordered set of subtasks using the following task types:\\n- \"search\": Perform a web search using a tool (e.g., Tavily) to locate and summarize high-quality, relevant sources, and summarise it in a content section.\\n- \"smart_search\": Generate a list of search queries based on the outputs of previous tasks, perform and summarise them.\\n- \"create\": Use a language model to generate specific content sections of the report.\\n- \"format\": Format the outputs of specified tasks into the final report structure.\\n\\n### Output Format:\\nYour output must be a valid JSON object following **EXACTLY** this structure:\\n{{\"tasks\":[[\"search\", [\"search query 1\", \"search query 2\"], []],[\"create\", \"task description\", [0]],[\"smart_search\", [], [1]],...,[\"create\",\"task description\",[0, 2]],[\"format\", \"\", [0, 2, 3]]]}}\\n\\n### Rules & Guidelines:\\n- Each task is a list of **EXACTLY** three elements:\\n1. The task type (\"search\", \"create\", \"smart_search\", or \"format\").\\n2. The task content:\\n\\t- A list of queries for \"search\"\\n\\t- A string for \"create\"\\n\\t- An empty string for \"smart_search\" and \"format\".\\n\\t-Do NOT omit the empty string in \"format\" or \"smart_search\" tasks.\\n3.

Make sure to pick **all the necessary search queries**.\\n- Do not include two consecutive \"search\" tasks. Merge their queries if necessary.\\n- Always place the \"format\" task at the end.\\n- The final report (\"format\") may include outputs from \"search\" and \"smart_search\" tasks.\\n- Your list of tasks **MUST** be comprehensive and ensure good coverage of the topic, but **AVOID SEARCHES WITH BIG OVERLAP**.\\n### Important:\\n- Output **only** the JSON object.\\n- Do **not** include any surrounding explanation or markdown formatting.\\nYou **SHOULD NOT** use a create task to summarise the search task. Search tasks provide already a summary of the search.",
